# Jam
## *Summary*
Jam is a music-focused social network application that connects people through events using Eventbrite's API. The Jam application allows users to search for music events by keyword, comment on events, and manage bookmarked events through their profile. Once logged in, the user can access their profile page to view a list of bookmarked events, as well as a map of bookmarked events, built using the Google Maps API. Users can connect with other Jam users via an email feature on the Jam application that uses SendGrid's emailing API. On the homepage, a user can view a list of recommended events based on the user's past search history. I built this feature by saving a users past searches in my database, written in SQL Alchemy, and using these saved searches to make a batched API request to eventbrite.
