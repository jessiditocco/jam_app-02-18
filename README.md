# *H1 Summary*
Jam is a music-focused social network application that connects people through events using Eventbrite's API. The Jam application allows users to search for music events by keyword, comment on events, and manage bookmarked events through their profile. Once logged in, the user can access their profile page to view a list of bookmarked events, as well as a map of bookmarked events, built using the Google Maps API. Users can connect with other Jam users via an email feature on the Jam application that uses SendGrid's emailing API.
